what we did good
    great job on the planning detail, not too granular, not too vague
    great velocity, progress was good and steady throughout
    estimates were accurate taking PR, deploy and monitoring into consideration
    quality of job done by PR people was awesome
    documentation for planning was really good (product/UI)

"challenges"
    lack of planning on who would review which PR to avoid context switching    
    temptation to skimp on the PR review questions   
    more thorough testing of designs
    
what we could do better
    put more thought into planning out who will take which PR and when
    more clearly identifying how urgent a PR will be and plan accordingly    
    if there are any adjustments, positive or negative, to the timeline communicate that more clearly to product/UI
